# StoryBook

This is my first time to use Storybook library, I've made a very simple project which contains only two components, a button component and a stack component, this project is merely meant for reference purposes, so that I can refer back to it when I forget something or I need to refresh my memory after a long time not using it.

## Tech I used

<ol>
	<li>React [obviously]</li>
	<li>Storybook</li>
	<li>MUI</li>
	<li>Webpack and Babel [for setting up the environment]</li>
